      <h1>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</h1>
      <p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Soon enough. I'm a thing. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
      <p>You're going to do his laundry? <strong> We don't have a brig.</strong> <em> Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?</em> Bite my shiny metal ass.</p>
      <h2>One hundred dollars.</h2>
      <p>So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</p>
      <ol>
      <li>And then the battle's not so bad?</li><li>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</li><li>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</h3>
      <p>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</li><li>Guess again.</li><li>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
      <p>We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! I can explain. It's very valuable. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>
      <p>Guess again. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Bender?! You stole the atom. Take me to your leader!</p>
      <p>Really?! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</p>
      <p>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?</p>
      <p>What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Oh God, what have I done? Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</p>
      <p>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Soon enough.</p>
      <p>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! We're also Santa Claus! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Actually, that's still true. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</p>
      <p>Bender, we're trying our best. Kids have names? I'm Santa Claus! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</p>
      <p>Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>
      <p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</p>

      <p>I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours' sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall go with him on another expedition. 27 September.--It was two o'clock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless. Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed. He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me.</p>
  
  <p>There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.</p>
  
  <p>"Is this a juggle?" I said to him.</p>
  
  <p>"Are you convinced now?" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth.</p>
  
  <p>"See," he went on, "see, they are even sharper than before. With this and this"--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below it--"the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend John?" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I could not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--</p>
  
  <p>"She may have been placed here since last night."</p>
  
  <p>"Indeed? That is so, and by whom?"</p>
